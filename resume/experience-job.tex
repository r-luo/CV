      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Fully owned the development of the next generation of our application fraud model}\\
        \begin{cvitems}
          \item {Migrated current model scoring pipeline from legacy platform to Python on AWS.}
          \item {Leading the development on real time model with our streaming platform.}
          \item {Exploring features generated from graph database (Neo4j).}
          \item {Experimented with multiple hyperparameter tuning and feature selection techniques.}\\
        \end{cvitems}
        \item {Built a core business model and its end-to-end scoring pipeline for predicting customer default.}\\
        \begin{cvitems}
          \item {The whole process involved sample selection, data pull, data cleaning and validation, feature engineering and selection, model build and validation, model deployment, and documentation.}
          \item {Worked with datasets on the magnitude of 100GB.}
          \item {Used SQL, SAS and Tableau for data cleaning and validation; used GBM and Bayesian model selection techniques in R for feature selection; explored genetic algorithm along the way.}
          \item {With careful data engineering (various variance stabilizing transformations, and splines) and model selection, our logistic regression model performed similarly to tree-based GBMs while being much more interpretable and stable over distributional shifts}
          \item {Deployed the model on our internal scoring platform as a Python package}
          \item {Guided by Agile principles: fast iterations of minimum viable product, quick adaptation to changes, and integration with business team for smooth communication}
          \item {Demonstrated the project to the broader business team and presented at company's internal conference.}\\
        \end{cvitems}
        \item {Wrote Python package to perform large-scale feature engineering in parallel on AWS. The package is now used across the company to standardize feature generation and documentation.}
        \item {Built Monte Carlo simulation tool in Python to simulate customer call queue and waiting time. It has greatly improved call centre staffing to shorten customer waiting time while reducing cost.}
        \item {Continuous monitoring of the input and performance of all internal statistical models with Tableau.}
      \end{cvitems}
